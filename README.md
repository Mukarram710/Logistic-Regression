# 🧠 Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

This project is part of my **AI & ML Internship Task 4**, where I built a binary classifier using **Logistic Regression** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**. The main goal was to understand how logistic regression works and how to evaluate a classification model using various metrics.

## 📌 Objective

- Build a binary classification model using **Logistic Regression**
- Learn how to evaluate it using **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, **ROC-AUC**
- Understand and visualize the **sigmoid function**
- Experiment with **threshold tuning**

---


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib & seaborn

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Loaded the dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
2. **Explored the data**: Checked for balance, structure, and stats
3. **Split** the data into training and testing sets (80/20)
4. **Standardized** the features using `StandardScaler`
5. **Trained** a Logistic Regression model
6. **Evaluated** the model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC Score
7. **Plotted** the ROC Curve 🎯
8. **Tuned** the threshold manually to improve recall/precision tradeoff
9. **Visualized** the sigmoid function to understand how Logistic Regression maps values to probabilities
